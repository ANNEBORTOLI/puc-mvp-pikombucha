## :notebook_with_decorative_cover:About the project

Pikombucha is entirely a frontend application using React, designed to provide a seamless and responsive user experience without relying on a backend server. This approach ensures quick loading times and smooth interactions, leveraging modern frontend technologies to deliver content and functionality directly to your browser.

Pikombucha utilizes frontend technologies such as React for building UI components, React Router DOM for managing navigation within the application, and @phosphor-icons/react for integrating icons seamlessly into the UI. These tools collectively contribute to Pikombucha's robust frontend capabilities, enhancing the user experience without requiring server-side processing.
